\chapter*{Abstract}

This report introduces the mathematical foundations of quantum theory and computing. Starting with developing key concepts including linear algebra, probability, Hilbert spaces, Dirac notation, and linear operators. Building on these concepts, the report then develops the mathematical framework for quantum phenomena including superposition, interference, uncertainty, measurement, and entanglement. The report then transitions to contextualising this framework within computation. Qubits, quantum gates and circuits, algorithms, and accessible quantum programming tools are all described starting from their mathematical basis. This report bridges theory to practice, providing an introduction to quantum theory and its computational potential.
